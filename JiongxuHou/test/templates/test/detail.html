{#The following template displays a radio button for each question choice. The value of each  #}
{#radio button is the associated question choice’s ID. The name of each radio button is "choice". #}
{#That means, when somebody selects one of the radio buttons and submits the form, it’ll send #}
{#the POST data choice=# where # is the ID of the selected choice. This is the basic concept of HTML forms.#}

<h1>{{ question.question_text }}</h1>

{% if error_message %}<p><strong>{{ error_message }}</strong></p>{% endif %}

{#We set the form’s action to {% url 'test:vote' question.id %}, and we set method="post".#}
{#Using method="post" (as opposed to method="get") is very important, because the act of submitting #}
{#this form will alter data server-side. Whenever you create a form that alters data server-side, #}
{#use method="post". This tip isn’t specific to Django; it’s just good Web development practice.#}
